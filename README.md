## Inversion of Control

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that promotes loosely coupled code by separating the responsibility of object creation and management from the objects that use them.
In traditional software design, objects are typically responsible for creating and managing their own dependencies. However, in IoC, this responsibility is inverted so that a separate component, known as the IoC container, is responsible for creating and managing the dependencies of the objects.

IoC containers provide a way to centralize the configuration and creation of objects, allowing them to be easily swapped out and tested in isolation. The container is responsible for instantiating objects, resolving their dependencies, and managing their lifecycle, while the objects themselves are only concerned with their own functionality.

Advantages to using IoC:
1.	Reduced coupling: By separating the creation and management of dependencies from the objects that use them, IoC reduces the coupling between objects, making it easier to modify and test individual components.
2.	Testability: IoC makes it easy to substitute dependencies with mock objects during testing, allowing for better unit testing and more reliable software.
3.	Reusability: IoC promotes the reuse of components by making them modular and easily interchangeable.
4.	Scalability: IoC makes it easier to manage large, complex applications by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.

# Autofac and Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
While both packages offer similar functionality, there are a few differences between the two that may make one more suitable than the other for certain use cases.
Autofac can do certain things that Microsoft's DI framework cannot.

That being said, it's important to note that Microsoft's DI framework is a more lightweight and simpler framework that may be sufficient for many applications. It is also built into the .NET Standard Library, which means that it requires no additional dependencies and has excellent support from Microsoft.

Overall, the choice between Autofac and Microsoft's DI framework depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your application. In general, if you require more advanced configuration options or integration capabilities, or if you need to use custom lifetime scopes or interceptors, then Autofac may be a better choice. If you are looking for a simple and lightweight DI framework that is built into the .NET Standard Library, then Microsoft's DI framework may be a good choice.
